New Appinventor extension that replaces Appinventor serial.
This extension uses an heavily updated version of PhysicaloidLibrary that solves a number of issues and refactored so it can coexist with the built in function when using 
AI Companion.
It has been tested with the following adapters: PL2303, PL2303HX, (PL2303HXN not implemented yet), FTDI FT232, CP210x, CH341, CH341 (“fake”)
CdcAcm: Original Arduino Uno, Adafruit Feather_M0 and CLUE, Micro:bit, Teensy, OpenCR. ATTINY85 using DigiCDC library.

Ver 1.0
"Serial" removed from method names. Functions have been added to control RTS, DTR, Parity, read/write bytes of any value, read/write ASCII hex coded data translated to bytes on the serial line and function to read and write byte lists-
A new function complement WriteLn (Prev PrintLn), ReadLn that collects data until a new-line char is received. This makes it simple to use ASCII messages communication. 
Available, Flush, DriverName added.

Ver 1.1 
Added some more boards

Ver 1.2
Upload of hex files to some Arduinos.
Added WIFI TCP server/client support. 
Added BT server/client support. 
Added isConnected() for BT, WIFI. 
Upload of hexfiles over BT possible. 
All read/write functions can be used with serial OTG, BT, WIFI. 

Ver 1.3
Add DIGISPARK ATTINY85 CDC  VID=16D0
Add CDC_ACM VID=10C4 PID=8C0F (EFM32LG360)

Ver 1.4
Add StopBits property

2212111  Add exaples on cotroling an Arduino LED

230410   Ver 1.5

Uppdated com.SerialOTG.aix, SeraialOTG.aia, SerialOTG.apk

Changes:
Compatible with Android12

Default driver CDC if no VID/PID defined in the extension

Possibility to force driver with property/method USBdriver. Must be set before open. See SerialOTG.apk (aia) for list of drivers

Extend timeout for TCP-client 0.5s->5s for connections over LTE

Ver 1.5.1
Improve FTDI write speed
